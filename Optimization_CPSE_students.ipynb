        "We have been using line search as a way to determine a reasonable value for the learning rate. However, in such approach, the learning rate $\\alpha$ is a unique value that is applied in all dimensions of the gradient. Can you see the problem of this? Imagine you have different ranges on each dimension of the gradient, then the learning rate will favour each dimension differently. One straightforward approach would be to have a learning rate for each dimension, i.e. the $\\alpha$ would be a vector instead of a scalar. The problem with this is that in many applications you can easily end-up with thousand or millions of dimensions (think about a Deep Neural Network). Therefore, one of the first approaches to this problem was AdaGrad, which adaptively scale the learning rate for each dimension. Another advantage is that we do not have to adjust the learning rate manually, as this is adaptively adjusted.\n",
